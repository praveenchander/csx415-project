##Loading the csv Data file:

raw_data <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\PraveenChander\\Desktop\\pySparking\\R Class for data science\\BankMarketing_Praveen\\data\\bank.csv', header = T,sep = ';')
head(raw_data)


#Sampling the data into 2 sets from the csv file:

ind <- sample(2,nrow(raw_data), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.8,0.2))
train_data <- raw_data[ind==1,]
test_data <- raw_data[ind==2,]
library(randomForest)


##Random Forest Model Fitting with Training Sample:

model <- randomForest(y ~ age + job + marital + education + balance + default + housing + loan + contact + duration + campaign + pdays + previous + poutcome, data = train_data)
print(model)

##Model Fitting with Test Sample:

model <- randomForest(y ~ age + job + marital + education + balance + default + housing + loan + contact + duration + campaign + pdays + previous + poutcome, data = test_data)
print(model)
